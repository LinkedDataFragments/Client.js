TODO:
    Take into account the additional knowledge we have when downloading all relevent triples for a pattern.
    Improve voting mechanism.
    Equivalent nodes: nodes with the same pattern (but possibly different variable names)
        Even more interesting if they have the same type of supply path.
    Pagesize is currently fixed at 100, need to read this from metadata.
    Do more research on best way to determine minimal node after voting.
    See if there is a way to introduce multithreading, or even just a way to do a HTTP call while we are processing the local DB.
    Check how much of the 'cost' functionality is actually still used.
    See what data from the database can still be re-used after changing the active stream for a node.
    Allow switching to bind stream.
        And keep store of other streams if switching back is necessary.
    We assume new results will always be at the end of the result array when checking for new results.
        Actually not 100% sure this is still correct after stream switching.
    If a bind pattern receives values, these come from executing some previous patterns.
        We might be able to reduce some operations in the DB by taking this knowledge into account.
    Improve stability logic.
    If streams get changed upstream, this might also change values for the streams downstream.
        Check how much of this needs to be taken into account.
    Edit the query to reduce calls.
        This is really generic, one example: { <u> <p1> ?o1; <p2> ?o2} might be solved more efficiently with { <u> ?p ?o }.
    Binding multiple variables in a pattern (currently limited to 1).

Things missing in paper:
    Cost function.
    Triple store path estimation.
    Triple store unique values.
